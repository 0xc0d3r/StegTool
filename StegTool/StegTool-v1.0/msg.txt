        Steganography means concealing the data. In ancient days, kings or emperors used to transfer the data
from one to another place by printing message on their head. Later, the hair will grow so the message is transfered
securely. Day by day, the TECHNOLOGY is improved and COMPUTER was invented. After that there is a drastic change in
people. They've developed so many algorithms to transfer the data from one person to other. 
        
        LSB(Least Significant Bit) algorithm is the one of the kind to embed data in images. In my project, I've
used this algorithm. Before inserting data, I encrypted the raw data and then I go for embedding.
